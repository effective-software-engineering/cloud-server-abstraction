# Goal

Design an API that abstracts away cloud server management for both AWS and Azure.

## Explanation

The goal is to create a software interface that simplifies and unifies the process of managing cloud servers on two major cloud platforms, Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure. This API should provide a high-level abstraction that shields developers from the intricacies of each cloud provider's specific operations, making it easier to work with cloud resources in a platform-agnostic way. The design should enable developers to create, monitor, update, and delete cloud servers seamlessly, regardless of whether they are hosted on AWS or Azure. This approach enhances code portability and flexibility, allowing for easier migration between cloud providers and facilitating multi-cloud strategies. It also simplifies the development process, reducing the need for extensive platform-specific knowledge and enabling more efficient use of cloud resources.
